# The Perfect Expand/Collapse Icon

## Still in progress! Just set this up quick and rough and I haven't finished yet. My jQuery skills are also non-existent. Please improve if you so desire!
### Notes
+ Using Neat and Bourbon with SASS with the help of Hammer
+ Current version of the demo here: http://markhokane.com/expand-collapse-icon/

## What I Want It To Do
+ To literally or symbolically say: this icon will open and show additional content.
+ Not easily be confused with doing something else, *exempli gratia*: A plus sign could be confused with adding or zooming.

## Problems
+ Solutions involving arrows are easily confused with existing conventions for resizing or sorting.
+ Text solutions such as 'less' or 'more' are vague and confusing; 'expand' and 'collapse' are too lengthy.

## Possible Solutions
+ Animated SVG (on hover)
  + This initial icon would have to be clear on touch devices (where hover is not an option) 
+ is the ‘i’ information symbol universal?
