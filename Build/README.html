<h1>The Perfect Expand/Collapse Icon</h1>

<h2>Still in progress! Just set this up quick and rough and I haven’t finished yet. My jQuery skills are also non-existent. Please improve if you so desire!</h2>
<p>### Notes
+ Using Neat and Bourbon with SASS with the help of Hammer
+ Current version of the demo here: http://markhokane.com/expand-collapse-icon/</p>

<h2>What I Want It To Do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To literally or symbolically say: this icon will open and show additional content.</li>
  <li>Not easily be confused with doing something else, <em>exempli gratia</em>: A plus sign could be confused with adding or zooming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Solutions involving arrows are easily confused with existing conventions for resizing or sorting.</li>
  <li>Text solutions such as ‘less’ or ‘more’ are vague and confusing; ‘expand’ and ‘collapse’ are too lengthy.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Animated SVG (on hover)
    <ul>
      <li>This initial icon would have to be clear on touch devices (where hover is not an option) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>is the ‘i’ information symbol universal?</li>
</ul>
